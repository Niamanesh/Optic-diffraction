# Optic-diffraction
This programme is written for data calculation for diffraction experiment.
In the input file, in the first column has to be written the number M, which is the number of the constructive interfrence.
The second column is for variable z, which is the distance between our specific bright point (constructive interfrence) and the center of coordinates.
The third column has to contain the distance between diffraction grating and the surface.

Please note that the all of the measurements has to be in SI system.

In the university laboratory we have many insutruments and each of them contain their own diffraction grating which means their period. For changing the value of this period u can change the value of ***r8_d*** in the code file.
